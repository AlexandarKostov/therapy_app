## About project

This app is about therapy where you can logged in as an admin,doctor or pacient and can schedule a call with doctors which they can give diagnose and etc.
 It's not finished because so if you need anything you can clone the project and try to modify it and finish the project.
 Started this project 3 months ago but didn`t had time to finish it because of work and etc so i just wanted to relase it here so i could have some backstory of my home made projects for practice 
 Thanks and enjoy
